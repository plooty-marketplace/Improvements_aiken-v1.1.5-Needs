**Benefit**: Better documentation helps new developers understand the language and its features more quickly.

### 5. Access Control Mechanisms

**Improvement**: Introduce built-in access control features.

**Code Snippet**:
```aiken
contract AccessControlled {
    address public owner;

    public function constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    public function restrictedFunction() {
        if (msg.sender != owner) {
            revert("Access denied: Only the owner can call this function");
        }
        // Critical operations
    }
}
